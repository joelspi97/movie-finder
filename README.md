# Movie-finder project

This is a project made just for fun and practice.

It features:
* An infinite scroll list, which retrieves data from an API to display movies (GET)
* An input which allows the user to search for specific titles (GET)
* A details page for each movie (GET)
* An option for users to be able to vote on movie ratings (POST)
* An option for users to remove any previous vote on a movie (DELETE)

To build it I'm using the following:
* React
* TypeScript
* Redux (+Thunk)
* Bootstrap
* Sass

This project uses the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/), but it's not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
