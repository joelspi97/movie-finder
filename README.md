# Movie-finder

This is a project made just for fun and practice.

It features:
* An infinite scroll list, which retrieves data from an API to display movies.
* An input which allows the user to search for specific titles.
* A details page for each movie that offers an option for users to be able to vote on movie ratings.
* An accessible UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used the following:
* React
* TypeScript
* Redux (+Thunk)
* Bootstrap
* Sass

This project uses the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/), but it's not endorsed or certified by TMDb.
